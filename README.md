# CiberLife

CiberLife is an entertainment project that simulates evolution using virtual creatures called bots. Each bot contains a small neural network that enables it to perform certain actions. In order to survive, bots require energy, which can be obtained through either killing other bots or photosynthesis. Additionally, bots can reproduce, at the cost of losing a portion of their energy.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project from GitHub.
2. Add the project to your existing solution in Visual Studio.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes the following dependencies:

- Qt
- Visual Studio

Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the project.

## Interface

The interface of CiberLife consists of a simulation field and a control panel.

### Control Panel Buttons

The control panel includes the following buttons:

- **Start/Stop**: Starts or stops the simulation.
- **Clear**: Clears the simulation field.
- **Skip**: Runs defined numbers of steps without visualisation.
- **Spawn**: Randomly generates bots on the field.
- **Display Mode**: Allows switching between different display modes: Family, Life, Energy, Age.
- **Save**: Saves the selected bot.
- **Load**: Loads a previously saved bot.
- **Bot to add**: Selects a bot to add to the field using the left mouse button (default: random).

### Control Panel Groups

The control panel also contains the following groups:

- **Values**: Allows modifying various values such as energy, update interval, probabilities, etc.
- **Features**: Enables or disables specific abilities or features of the bots.

## Usage

1. Launch the CiberLife project in Visual Studio.
2. Use the control panel to configure the simulation settings and select the desired display mode.
3. Click the **Start** button to begin the simulation.
4. Observe the bots' actions and interactions on the simulation field.
5. Use the provided buttons and options to control and manipulate the simulation as desired.

Feel free to experiment with different settings and observe the evolution of the bots in the simulated environment!
